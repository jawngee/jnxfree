	<p/>
	<p/>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed disconnect on hosts that provided multiple authentication methods, even though one of them was, that no authentication was needed.
		<li>Fixed cancel of authentication when first authentication did not get authenticated.
		<li>Password panel now saves state of saving to keychain.
	</ul>

<p>Version 0.96.74 (901011) Sat Jan 10 14:31:44 2009<br/>
	<p/>
	<p/>
	<ul>

	</ul>

<p>Version 0.96.72 (900906) Fri Jan  9 22:04:48 2009<br/>
	<p/>
	<p/>
	<ul>
		<li>Added new password panel support, allows selection of authentication method. Passwords are now stored differently in the KeyChain. You may freely remove the old keys which are just name JollysFastVNC. The new keys are named 'JollysFastVNC: connectionname'.
		<li>Added support Mac special VNC authentications ( password/ask ) .
		<li>Added support for vnc 4.0 servers.
	</ul>

<p>Version 0.96.70 (834608) Thu Dec 11 16:33:58 2008<br/>
	<p/>
	<p/>
	<ul>
		<li>Added SSH password login. Now creating ssh tunnels works even if you don't have sshkeys installed on the remote machine.
		<li>Added SSH hostidentifcation warning handling.
		<li>Password panel show now which password is asked for.
	</ul>
<p>Version 0.96.68 (833802) Wed Dec  3 16:15:15 2008<br/>
	<p/>
	<p/>
	<ul>
		<li>Removed SOCKS support for 10.4 as it does not work correctly.
		<li>Updated TCM Portmapper library to version 1.1r30.
	</ul>

<p>Version 0.96.66 (832904:0c76b93) Mon Nov 24 12:15:37 2008<br/>
	<p/>
	<p/>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed possible crash for screen resize to 0 pixels (KVM bug).
		<li>Updated revision number to be compatible with Sparkle again.
	</ul>

<p>Version 0.96.64 (5b88b11) Wed Nov 19 19:33:43 2008<br/>
	<p/>
	<p/>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed possible crash on ssh connection startup.
	</ul>
<p>Version 0.96.62 (c4e1c65) Tue Nov 18 15:25:16 2008<br/>
	<p/>
	<p/>
	<ul>
		<li>Added '-L' ssh switch awareness. If you use a ssh connection and use the '-L' option to eg. '-L 9999:foo.bar:3000' it will use the local port 9999 to connect to the tunnel. This way you can connect to other machines on a remote network that are only reachable via one ssh host.
		<li>Added internal rich cursor support (not visible yet) to prevent unbehaved servers like ultra vnc sc from working.
		<li>Workaround possible problem in sparkle framework.
		<li>duplicate bonjour hosts fix for large networks.
		<li>Changed source control system to git - version numbers will now look different.
	</ul>

<p>Version 0.96.60 (2002) Thu Oct 16 12:07:26 2008<br/>
	<p/>
	<p/>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed 10.4 update drawer bug.
	</ul>
<p>Version 0.96.58 (2000) Thu Oct 16 11:00:08 2008<br/>
	<p/>
	<p/>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed nib file bug where the drawer got drawn incorrectly when changing to/from SSH security type.
	</ul>
<p>Version 0.96.56 (1994) Wed Oct 15 17:57:26 2008<br/>
	<p/>
	<p/>
	<ul>
		<li><font color=green>Added SSH tunnel creation support !</font> Current implementation only works if you have keys installed on the remote machine.
		<li>Changed back from Fullscreen to CMD-ESC in invasive mode.
		<li>Changed sending of ctrl-alt-del to CMD-CTRL-ESC.
		<li>Improved mac-keyboard support to better support international keyboards on ARD servers.
		<li>Improved connection time as the same resolved ip's are only checked once.
		<li>Added workaround for servers that do not send the correct colordepth.
		<li>Removed timeout for connections as some servers are really slow ;-( .
		<li>Improved second mouse button emulation as a scroll wheel no longer deactivates it.
	</ul>

<p>Version 0.96.54 (1973) Tue Oct  7 11:43:48 2008<br/>
	<p/>
	<p/>
	<ul>
		<li>fixed shift left click by removing middle mouse button emulation.
		<li>fixed order of thread tree deconstruction.
		<li>increased connection read/write timeout for slow connections.
	</ul>

<p>Version 0.96.52 (1962) Thu Oct  2 16:44:47 2008<br/>
	<p/>
	<p/>This version is very different internally, so it might run rough on the edges ;-)
	<ul>
		<li>added SOCKS support. If you have a SOCKS proxy configured, JollysFastVNC will use it. It will only work on IP addresses not named servers though.
		<li>added SSL support. You can now directly connect to SSL vnc servers. SSH tunneling will be added soon :-)
		<li>removed ctrl-alt-backspace special key handling as it can be reached on a notebook via ctrl-alt-fn-backspace.
		<li>mouse moving outside the window will no longer create movement on the server (dragging still works outside).
		<li>added smart ctrl clicks. As soon as you click right once ctrl clicks go through otherwise left mouse button is emulated.
		<li>added third mouse button emulation. Shift-left click emulates the middle mouse button.
		<li>major internal re-factoring.
	</ul>

<p>Version 0.96.50 (1932) Fri Sep 19 22:47:53 2008<br/>
		<p/>
		<ul>
			<li>fixed keyboard selection (was always invasive) as I did not update the nib file accordingly.
			<li>ctr-alt-backspace now sends ctrl-alt-delete to PC's - added for MacBook owners.
			<li>added initial dead-key support for PC keyboards. You can now type keys like quote and backquote on a Mac German keyboard.
		</ul>

<p>Version 0.96.48 (1929) Thu Sep 18 18:44:59 2008<br/>
		<p/>
		<ul>
			<li>removed pasting for Apples ARD server as it does not support the open VNC paste protocol.
			<li>Added initial PC keyboard support. Keyboard Input has now three values:
				<dl>
					<dt>Normal</dt><dd>On a connection to a Apples Remote Server the remote keyboard layout is used, regardless of your local keyboard layout.<br>
									 On a connection to a PC/Linux machine the local keys are sent. Beware though! Your keyboard has to have the same layout (e.g. German layout) as the remote machine to get this to work. Furthermore VNC servers on PC's usually can't handle a keyboard change while you are connected. So changing the keyboard layout on the remote or local machine while connected will have weird results.
									</dd>
					<dt>Invasive</dt><dd>Same as Normal but also CMD-f,CMD-q, CMD-1,2,3 are send to the remote machine instead of using it for resize the window. ESC returns from fullscreen.</dd>
					<dt>None</dt><dd>No keyboard or cursor movement is send to the remote machine</dd>
				</dl>
				<b>Your previous keyboard type settings are reset to default which is now INVASIVE !</b>
		</ul>
		<p/>I expect that some people will have keyboard issues. I've tested it with UltraVNC and RealVNC on Windows, ARD and Vine on Tiger, ARD on Leopard. With a german and an american keyboard layout. Everything worked fine except that the quote key wasn't typeable on the german keyboard. You can always reach that via the right ALT key on Windows ( which works now ) and typing in the number of the character you want ( ALT-39 for tick ). Seems that WinVNC is interpreting the right ALT key correctly wereas Ultra VNC does not.

<p>Version 0.96.46 (1919) Mon Sep 15 19:07:46 2008<br/>

<ul>
		<li>added invasive keyboard type. This will forward all command keys like cmd-w, cmd-f. You can exit fullscreen by using 'ESC' pressing ESC in window mode will send ESC.
		<li>added slow server workaround. On some servers JollysFastVNC stalls the server by frequently asking for updates. This workaround only sends updates when JollysFastVNC is getting back some updates.
	This workaround might slow down performance on very high performance servers other than ScreenRecycler. As I do have no knowledge of other high performance servers like ScreenRecycler let me know when this build is slower.
		<li>fixed double cancel on keychain cancel.
		<li>fixed last frame not drawn in some cases bug, when the server did not send further updates.

<ul>
		<li>fixed double keys that appeared on some pc-like servers.

		<li>fixed CAPS on pc-like servers.

<ul>
		<li>changed hidden cursor for non fullscreen windows.
		<li>fixed cursor hide bug when application becomes active again.
